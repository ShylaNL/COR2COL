# Colocalization Analysis for Cell-Cell Interactions (COR2COL)

In this project, we delve into a publicly accessible Visium dataset from 10X Genomics, focusing on the human lymph node. Our approach integrates single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from human secondary lymphoid organs to identify a variety of cell types. By achieving co-localization for each pair of cell types, we introduce a new dimension to understanding their spatial distribution, frequency, and interaction intensity. This analysis not only sheds light on the subtle dynamics of cellular behavior but also enhances our exploration of how cells operate within their environments. Furthermore, this methodology employs a robust test for assessing the correlation coefficients of spatial distributions between two cell types. This provides researchers with deeper insights into cellular behaviors and tissue structures, laying a solid groundwork for the investigation of complex intercellular relationships.
